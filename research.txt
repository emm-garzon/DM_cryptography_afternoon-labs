In 2018 a vulnerability allowed hackers to compromise at least 50 million Facebook user accounts. The attackers used the Facebook developer APIs to obtain information linked to a user's profile page; the information taken included: NAME, GENDER, and HOMETOWNS. At first it did not appear that private messages, and/or credit card information was compromised, but Facebook preemptively secured 40 million additional account as a precaution. In response to the breach, Facebook reset access tokens for some 90 million users. It is reported that the vulnerability was in place in July 2017 when Facebook inadvertantly introduced 3 vulnerabilities in its video uploader. When using the 'view as' feature, the uploader would appear (when it shouldnt) and generated an access token which could be used to log into another person's account. Facebook themselves were not aware of it until September 2018 when it noticed a spike in unusual activity. Unfortunately this means that the hackers could have had access long before they were discovered. The FBI conducted an extensive investigation, and Facebook reported that the vulnerability was fixed on September 27.
